<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Many schools have softwares on school devices that have restriction capabilities. Students may use various methods to bypass thes technologies,
    and often land themselves in trouble for doing this. However EduGames is diffrent then that. We include quality educational games that hone skills in these topics. This makes 
    EduGames perfect for a choice board activity after a lesson, or a quick game implemented into the lesson.</h2>
<h1>Terms of use</h1>
<h2>Despite EduGames being an educational game website, sometimes, teachers may not want students to use EduGames in class. This does not give any reason
    to make rid of EduGames, as we are not responsible for misbehavior, as we can not physically control these disobedient students. Instead, encourage them to use it during break time.
</h2>
<h1>Notice</h1>
<h2>Most of the games are either made by me, (DotLYHiyou) or come from mrnussbaum.com or Field Day Learning Games. I would like to give a shoutout to the talented devs of these games and wish them the very best.</h2>
